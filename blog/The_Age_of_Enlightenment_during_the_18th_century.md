The Age of Enlightenment during the 18th century was characterized by a secular intellectual trend and a flourishing of philosophical writing. Many 18th century philosophers defended 
women’s rights, including: Jeremy Bentham, the Marquis de Condorcet, Olympe de Gouges, and Mary Wollstonecraft. Jeremy Bentham (1748 - 1832) The classical liberal philosopher Jeremy
 Bentham said that women’s secondary status in law was what made him choose the job of a reformer at the age of eleven. Bentham advocated full gender equality, giving women all their 
rights, including the right to vote, political participation, and divorce. Bentham also opposed the standards of dual sexual ethics between a man and a woman. Bentham condemned the 
violation by many countries of women’s rights on the grounds of their irrationality.
Marquis de Condorcet (1743 - 1794) The Marquis de Condorcet was a classical liberal mathematician and politician and a staunch advocate of human rights, advocated equality between men
 and women, and supported women’s suffrage in 1790.
Olympe de Gouges (1748 - 1793) Olympe de Gouges published her book, The Declaration of the Rights of Women in 1791, and it was considered one of the most important regulations that
 led the French revolutionary government to recognize the natural and political rights of women. De Gouges wrote her book in the same style as the Declaration of the Rights of Man 
and of the Citizen, mocking the failure of men to include more than half of French society under the shadow of equality (egalité).
Mary Wollstonecraft (1759 - 1797) Wollstonecraft is considered the most prominent feminist thinker of the period, and is considered by many to be the first feminist philosopher.
 Her book In Defense of Women’s Rights was the first intellectual work that could be explicitly called a “feminist work”, although - by modern standards - many of his ideas are now
 considered antiquated thesis. Wollstonecraft noted that both genders were involved in supporting inequality. She called for women to be educated, respected and treated as human beings.
 Wollstonecraft is an example of the first case of rejection of the female role that society dictates to women. The site from which the search was taken is gender wiki
