19th century.
This century is a historic qualitative hop in science and various industries, a lot of political transformation and many geographical changes which made us create a new world we never experienced.
We can see women of color being more recognized and represented in STEM, as it is believed that in this century science finally was a proper job.
Women’s scientific state in this century was at its best since the Islamic golden age, but still, there was much to go.
The second industrial revolution and the numerous wars at that time left their impact on women. They are finally participating in new fields like Engineering, Nuclear physics, Archaeology, Microbiology, etc.
There were an enormous number of amazing women at that time who did amazing things as well. A lot of them were the first in their domain.

-Rebecca Lee Crumpler
Dr Rebecca Lee Crumpler was the first Black woman to earn a medical degree in the United States. Born Rebecca Davis in Delaware on February 8 1831, Crumpler was raised by an aunt in Pennsylvania who often helped care for sick neighbors. Those early experiences made her want to work to “relieve the suffering of others.” In the early 1850s, she moved to Massachusetts and became a nurse.
Crumpler earned a place at the New England Female Medical College (NEFMC) in 1860. At that time most medical schools barred Black students regardless of gender.

-Olga Fedchenko
Olga was a Russian botanist, who was born in Moscow in 1845. In 1906, Olga Fedtschenko became the second female corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences
Olga named one species of plant, Fritillaria seravschanica but she never published it (to validate the name). Later, another Russian botanist Alexei Vvedensky, a monocot specialist, appears to have changed Olga’s temporary epithet to Fritillaria olgae and formally described it in her son Boris Fedtschenko’s book ‘Flora Turkmenistan’.
She died on 24 April 1921 in Petrograd which is now called Saint Petersburg.

-Kadambini Ganguly

Kadambini Bose Ganguly was one of the first Indian female doctors who practiced with a degree in modern medicine. She was the first Indian woman to practice medicine in India. She was born on 18 July 1861. Despite coming from an upper caste Bengali community that did not support women’s education, Kadambini initially received English education at the Brahmo Eden Female School, Dacca; subsequently, at Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya, Ballygunj Calcutta which was renamed as Banga Mahila Vidyalaya in 1876.
Our dear Kadambini left us on October 3, 1923, in Kolkata, India.

Lin Lanying
Lin Lanying was a Chinese electrical engineer, materials scientist, physicist, and politician. She is called the “mother of aerospace materials” and the “mother of semiconductor materials” in China. She was born in Putian City, Fujian Province, in southern China, on February 7, 1918.
Throughout her life, she faced difficulties as a female. After she returned from the US, she joined the All-China Women’s Federation. She held a lot of conferences and talked about gender issues. As a woman, she never accepted gender roles and always fought for herself.
